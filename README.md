Here is a list of what the command do
*  Creates a new Laravel project with the name supplied.
*  Creates a new database with the given name and seed it with random datas.
*  Sets up a basic CRUD on the datas and expose them as an API.
*  Creates an Angular app that consumes the API. You will be able to add, remove, update and delete randoms.

Also make sure your local database server and application server are up and running before executing the command.
